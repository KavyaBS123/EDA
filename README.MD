# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Machinery Datasets

## Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on datasets related to various industrial machines, including:
- Bending Machine
- CNC Machine
- Hydraulic Press
- Injection Moulding Machine
- VMC (Vertical Machining Center)

The goal is to understand the data, uncover patterns, and gain insights into machine operations and performance.

## Project Structure

- `BENDINGMACHINE.ipynb`: EDA for Bending Machine dataset
- `CNCMACHINE.ipynb`: EDA for CNC Machine dataset
- `HYDRAULICPRESS.ipynb`: EDA for Hydraulic Press dataset
- `INJECTIONMOULDING.ipynb`: EDA for Injection Moulding dataset
- `VMCDATASET.ipynb`: EDA for VMC dataset

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Imported datasets for each machine
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Standardized column names

2. **Data Exploration**

   - Distribution analysis (histograms, boxplots)
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Visualization**
   - Plotted trends and relationships
   - Used scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features for deeper insights
   - Analyzed categorical and numerical variables

5. **Key Insights**
   - Identified factors affecting machine performance
   - Detected anomalies and operational patterns
